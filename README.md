# Project Bolt Backend!

**Tagline:**  
An online office supply store like Staples—faster, smarter, and more reliable.

## What It Is  
Backend services powering a modern e-commerce platform for office and workplace essentials with real-time inventory, personalized discovery, and enterprise-friendly fulfillment.

## Key Capabilities
- **Smart Search & Discovery:** Typo-tolerant, intent-aware product search with dynamic relevance.  
- **Accurate Inventory:** Live stock across sources with reservation logic to avoid oversells.  
- **Personalization:** Contextual recommendations and predicted reorders.  
- **Flexible Checkout:** Persistent carts, multi-source fulfillment, and adaptive pricing (volume/enterprise).  
- **Order Lifecycle:** Orchestrated placement → fulfillment → tracking → returns.  
- **Secure Payments & Accounts:** Tokenized payments, role-based access, and customer profiles.

## Simplified Flow
1. User searches → Catalog/Search service returns results.  
2. Items added to cart → inventory reserved.  
3. Checkout triggers pricing, payment, and order creation.  
4. Fulfillment executes and status updates propagate to user.  
5. Behavior feeds recommendations and analytics.

## Tech Snapshot
- **API:** REST/gRPC behind gateway  
- **Search:** Elasticsearch/OpenSearch  
- **Data:** PostgreSQL (core), Redis (cache), Kafka (events)  
- **Background Work:** Worker queues for syncs, model refreshes  
- **Observability:** Tracing, metrics, alerting  
- **Security:** TLS, RBAC, input validation, payment tokenization

## Why We're Better
Real-time accuracy, smarter suggestions, enterprise features (bulk, subscriptions), and transparent fulfillment—all built to scale and recover gracefully.
